# odin-recipes
This is my take on the project Odin-Recipes!

I think I managed pretty nicely on this project. I wouldn't call it neat
but it's good enough! I used all the concepts introduced so far to make 
the site as I like (headers, list, links, images, pararaphs). 

This (I hope) is just the beginning of my journey. With these basics 
hopefully I'll be able to improve more and easier on the long run as a 
webdev!
