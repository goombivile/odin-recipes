		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This is a family recipe supposedly going back in a straight 
		line at least to the Tudors (I'm English). The ingredients and 
		method make it possible - even probable. It goes back at least 5 
		generations to my certain knowledge.</p>
		
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 (0.6 ounce) cake compressed fresh yeast</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons castor sugar or superfine sugar</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
			<li>2 cups cold water</li>
			<li>7 teaspoons castor sugar or superfine sugar, divided</li>
			<li>7 teaspoons ground ginger, divided</li>
			<li>3 ¾ cups white sugar</li>
			<li>5 cups boiling water</li>
			<li>12 ½ cups cold water</li>
			<li>½ cup strained fresh lemon juice</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>In a sterile 2 quart jar, blend together the yeast, 2 
			teaspoons of castor sugar, and 2 teaspoons of ground ginger. 
			Stir in the cold water until well blended. Cover with a 
			clean cheesecloth, and let sit in a convenient corner at 
			room temperature where it will be out of the way for the 
			next seven days.</li>
			<li>Every morning for the next seven days, feed the yeast 
			mixture by stirring in 1 teaspoon of castor sugar, and 1 
			teaspoon of ground ginger.</li>
			<li>On the eighth day, give the mixture a good stir, then 
			strain it through a clean tea towel into a large new plastic 
			bucket, bin, or glass carbuoy. Wring all of the liquid out 
			of the cloth, and set aside. You will be dealing with this 
			later.</li>
			<li>Dissolve the white sugar in 5 cups of boiling water by 
			stirring vigorously. Pour the cold water into the bucket 
			with the ginger juice, then stir in the sugar syrup and 
			lemon juice.</li>
			<li>Siphon the mixture into sterile screw top bottles, 
			filling to within 2 inches of the top. Old cleaned out soda 
			bottles will do. Screw on the tops tightly. Store the 
			bottles of ginger beer in a cool dark place where they can 
			remain undisturbed for 7 days. Be very careful upon opening 
			as the beer is very fizzy.</li>
			<li>Go back to the cloth now. The residue looks disgusting! 
			However, lay the towel out flat with the disgusting side up. 
			Use a knife to scrape the stuff to the center, then divide 
			in half, and place each half into a separate sterile jar. 
			Top each jar with 2 cups of cold water, and you are ready to 
			go again. Twice! Begin with step 2 for subsequent batches. 
			Unless you are very thirsty, I suggest you give one of them 
			away.</li>
		</ol>
